## Install

From a bash shell, go to your local repository (let's say `~/repository/project_one`) and run this command: 

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cavo789/bash_git_hooks/main/install.sh)"
```

This will download the content `install.sh` script from this repo and will execute it.

You'll be prompted if you want to install hooks for the current repository or globally.
